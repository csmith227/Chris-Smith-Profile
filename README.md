<h1>Chris Smith-My  Profile - Assesment 1</h1>
<h1>Details</h1>
Name: Chris Smith
<p>Student Number: s3794202.</p>
<p>Email Address: csmith@cashelhg.com</p>


<h1>About Me</h1>

Hello! My name is Chris Smith and I am 29 years old. My life pretty much consists of working, playing sport, renovating my house and spending quality time with my parter and dog. I have finally decided to start a University degree. I work in the finance industry, which is continuuing to try to improve it's image in the face of recent Royal Commission's setting out new rules for advisers that they must have a degree to work in the industry. I begin this degree with a touch of the unknown, having never returning to univeristy  after deferring as an 18 year old. 
I have no real experience in the IT space, and feel like  i have jumped into the deepend in this first subject. I am hoping to learn a vast array of skills in this subject, skills i can take with me into the work force that will make me more productive and more appealing for future employers. I am studying a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) through Open Universities. With this degree, it will allow me to provide personalized financial advice to clients as well as constructing financial plans and implementing advice. 

<p>Although i have no experience in the IT industry, it is still one that fascinates me and sparks a lot of interest in me. I have always thought it would be a hard industry to get into due to the ever evolving nature of technology but i feel that that is also one of the reasons why it would be so fascinating. As before mentioned, I am really hoping that this Introduction to IT course will provide me with a sound base for me to use to further my career.   </p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>Please find the below link to a current job ad for a job that interests me </p>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/Job/38567519/?cid=ios-share">Seek- Cyber Security Analyst</a>
<p> I have chosen a role as a Senior Cyber Security Analyst for a large US banking institution as my ideal job, as cyber security is something I am really interested in. Cyber security is an ever growing issue with greater number of attacks occurring than ever. The role is a very hands on role and it comes with the responsibilty of ensuring the banks cybe security is monitored and maintained. To be considered for this position, I would need to have first put in years of work to gain the experience required for such an important job. Cyber Security is becoming more and more important within organizations and banks require the  utmost skilled cyber security team to prevent crimes occuring.</p>

<p>There is a number of programs and tools I would need to know how to use to be elliglble for this job. The first step for me would be to begin a degree in Cyber Security, as this is the most direct way to gain an entry level position in the industry. The course can be completed in 3 years and can be completed through Open Universities.</p>

<p>Currently I have no experience in the IT industry, so I feel It would be a big change of lifestyle for me to move into an IT career. To be realistic, I believe I would be 7-10 years away at least from being able to be considered for a role of such magnitude. It may seem like an eternity away, but the remuneration and interest in the job provides a high level of motivation for me. </p>

<p>My plan would involve beginning my Cyber Security degree through Open University and completing that. I would then use my degree to seek employment as a junior Cyber Security Analyst, where I could hone my skills and gain some meaningful work experience in the industry. After completing a number of years in this role, I would then seek employment as a Senior Cyber Security Analyst. </p>

<p>I found the personality tests interesting, yet somewhat relatively similar to each other in the questions being asked. So with this, it was clear that I was going to achieve similar results. The tests were good to do however didn’t tell me anything I didn’t  already know about myself. The results painted me as very much of an introvert, and my learning style as visual. Upon reflecting on the results, which just further showed me what I already thought of myself, I think that I need to push myself out of my comfort zone a bit more and test myself when it comes to social situations. I have always held back my opinion out of fear of confrontation, and I feel this transpires into my studies by not voicing my opinion nearly as much as I should. Now that the tests confirmed my suspicions, I will look to begin recitifying these issues to try and better myself going forward.  </p>

<p>As I mentioned, working in a team in the past I have not voiced my opinion or given contructive criticism to my peers. I have always been happy to sit back and be told what to do or go with other peoples ideas rather than my own. Seeing the results, I think that it is time to start changing my ways (or attemt to) so and be more involved in group discussiions. It means coming out of my comfort zone which I think in turn will make me a better team member and person.  </p>

<p>When forming a team, going by the test results I should not be placed with other introverts, as we tend to be more reserved and may not fully voice our opinions. I think working with extroverts in groups in the past has been good for me as they are able to get more out of me, and I have usually been more that willing to be told what to do.  </p>


<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>My project idea is to create an app called PupPlayz for iphone and andoid which acts as a social hub for pet owners looking for play dates with their furry friend. The idea is that the dog owner logs on through the app if they are wanting to take their dog for an outing at the park. Once logged on, you are able to be matched with other dog owners who have also logged on who are either at a park or wanting to go to the park but are waiting on other members to log on. The app is able to track you and locate parks within a 5km radius. This way you are able to socialize your dog with other dogs in the area aswell as potentially making friends yourself. </p>

<p> The pet industry has boomed recently. Due to the high costs of living, ‘Fur Babies’ are replacing normal babies as the average age of parents increases. Companies listed on the ASX like Greencross, who own Petparn and Vet clinics, shares price has risen considerably as the money spent on pets increases around Australia. I know from experience, that dog beaches and dog parks are extremely busy, and catchups between dog breeds are usually coordinated on Facebook and promoted as play dates. Creating a central hub I think would be beneficial.  </p>

<p>Once the app has launched you can either select to use your current location or select a postcode in which you are heading. Once you make your selection, you are then matched with other members who have logged on. For example, if I was wanting to take my dog to the park around the corner,  I would then log on and see which other dogs have ‘checked in’ to the park. If only a couple of dogs were present at that park, but then I notice that many dogs were present at another park in the area, I could then save myself some time and head to the more popular park so that my dog can socialize at the popular park. The app will also have a best friends feature, in which you can bookmark your dogs friends so that you get a notification when they log on and check in to a park. 
Another feature of the app would include a groups feature. For example, their could be a French Bulldog group in which owners of French Bulldogs can get together for same breed play dates. </p>

<p>I would use MIT App Inventor to create a customer friendly user interface and have locations services function in built in the app. If the project was successful and we felt we had a niche in the market the app would be free to begin with for users, and we would look to generate revenue through advertisments until the app grew. </p>
